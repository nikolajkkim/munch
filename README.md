Time to Munch!

## Inspiration
The inspiration for Munch stemmed from a desire to create a food-related app, similar to Bereal, with a unique twist on incorporating food experiences. We envisioned a platform that would allow users to seamlessly share their dining adventures.

## What it does
Munch enables users to capture and share their dining experiences by posting pictures with ratings and short captions. The app curates a feed of the latest posts from friends, creating a dynamic and engaging social space centered around food.

## How we built it
We utilized tools such as React Native for mobile development, along with Expo and Expo Go for real-time rendering on our devices. Despite being our first venture into React Native, we navigated through challenges, learning along the way.

## Challenges we ran into
Our primary challenges included grappling with React Native for the first time, encountering issues with Git, and figuring out the intricacies of implementing a cloud-based database like Firebase.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have developed a functional app, overcoming hurdles with limited web development skills. The accomplishment lies in turning our concept into a tangible, working product.

## What we learned
Through this project, we gained valuable insights into React and React Native, laying the groundwork for future development endeavors. Overcoming challenges taught us to troubleshoot effectively and adapt to new technologies.

## What's next for Munch 
Moving forward, our focus is on fully implementing a database system, incorporating live updates, and integrating user authentication to enhance the overall user experience. The journey continues towards making Munch a go-to platform for sharing and discovering delightful dining experiences.
